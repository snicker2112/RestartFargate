    "#### Fargate restart python script including user input or programmatic input\n",
    "\n",
    "The script is designed to automate the process of restarting a service in Amazon ECS Fargate. Here's a breakdown of the different functions in the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "    check_prerequisites(): This function checks if awscli and boto3 are installed by attempting to import them. If either module is not installed, it prompts the user to confirm whether they want to install them using pip. If the user confirms, it installs the missing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "    configure_aws_credentials(): This function prompts the user to select between using a named AWS CLI profile or programmatically configuring their AWS credentials. If the user chooses to use a named profile, it prompts the user to enter the name of their profile. If the user chooses to configure their credentials programmatically, it prompts the user to enter their AWS access key ID, secret access key, and preferred AWS region name. It then creates a boto3.Session object with the selected configuration and returns the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "    test_aws_connectivity(session): This function takes a boto3.Session object as input and tests the AWS connectivity by making a simple call to the describe_instances() method of the EC2 client. If the connection fails, an error message is printed and the script exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "    select_service_to_restart(session): This function takes a boto3.Session object as input and prompts the user to enter the name of their ECS cluster. It then retrieves a list of all the services in the selected cluster using the list_services() method of the ECS client. It then prompts the user to select a service to restart by entering the number of the service in the list. It then restarts the selected service by calling the update_service() method of the ECS client with the forceNewDeployment=True parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    test_service_restart(session): This function takes a boto3.Session object as input and prompts the user to enter the name of the ECS cluster and the name of the service to test. It then retrieves a list of all the tasks in the selected service using the list_tasks() method of the ECS client. It waits for the tasks to stop by repeatedly calling the describe_tasks() method until the task count is 0. Finally, it confirms that the service has restarted successfully by calling the list_tasks() method again and checking if the task count is greater than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the main program flow of the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Check if AWS CLI and Boto3 are installed using check_prerequisites().\n",
    "\n",
    "    Configure AWS credentials using configure_aws_credentials().\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test AWS connectivity using test_aws_connectivity().\n",
    "\n",
    "    Select a service to restart using select_service_to_restart().\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test if service restart is successful using test_service_restart()."
